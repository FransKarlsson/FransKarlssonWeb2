                Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and it has been written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots.

                Each board has a set number of mines distrobuted randomly across the intire board. Each tile has a number between 0 and 8, 0 is simply represented with an empty tile. The number represents how many mines there are somewhere in the 8 tiles around the tile. If you know that a tile doesn't have a mine then it is safe to reveal and if you know that a tile contains a mine then you can flag it by r-clicking.
